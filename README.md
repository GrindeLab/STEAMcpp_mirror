This is a working version of STEAMcpp. We are in the progress of writing vignettes and publishing in a broader setting.

To download this version of the pacakge, download the tar.gz file and install in R.

We just made a better version without the warnings and 1 note remaining. Check here: https://github.com/GrindeLab/STEAMcpp.
